# HEAD PREFECT’S MESSAGE
 
My name is Bukirwa Lucy Lee. The President of Sir Apollo Kaggwa Boarding Primary School Old Kampala. I thank God for making me what I am and for continuously showing me what I should be doing as a leader. Dear parents I urge you to encourage us as children to take on the mantle of leadership at a young age. Leadership comes with some level of responsibility which in turn helps us shape our characters.

 
It is also a great way that we can be able to analyze our own strengths and weaknesses at an early age setting personal and vocational goals, gaining self-esteem, confidence and ability to guide and direct others on a course of action and serve as role models. I thank all the staff of Sir Apollo Kaggwa Boarding Primary school for carefully nurture us into responsible citizens.
I remain
 - **Bukirwa Lucy Lee**
 - **CURRENT PRESIDENT**
