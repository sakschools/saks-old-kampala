## Head Teacher
On behalf of the Manage­ment, Ad­ministration, staff and pupils, I give sincere honor to the almighty for the pre­cious life and knowledge, God has passed on to us, the Sir Apollo Kaggwa community, our dear Parents and our Country at Large.

Sir Apollo Kaggwa is a renowned boarding school in Kampala respected for its academic excellence manifested over the years. The school started in 1996 with 300 pupils. Since then, it has grown in the academ­ic structures, popula­tion and staff. Today, the school has 1092 pupils all accom­modated in spacious and modern dormitories and class­rooms.

The school has maintained its remarkable academic excellence and pupil’s welfare and this is attribut­ed to the committed and caring Directors, Administrators, parents as well as the committed staff.

Our school provides quality education to the young generation. The service is holistic in nature that by the time the child leaves our school, he or she is responsible, social, creative, God fearing and hardworking.

I dedicate all my work to GOD for the guidance and protection and also encourage  continued Team work from all stake holders so as to produce desired goals. I wish to thank parents for choosing our school and all the support rendered. I promise that our pupils will be modeled into very responsible citizens.

I appeal to staff and pupils to dedicate all our work to God because edu­cation without God does not make one educated, but a clever devil.

To our new dear parents in the school, we thank you for joining us in the struggle. Indeed you made a perfect choice that you will never regret. We prom­ise to give you wonderful customer care and quality education to our children .

To the parents/ guardians, you have been reliable partners in this humble endeavor of educating our beloved children who are elite citi­zens of our nation.

We shall remain focused towards maintaining and achieving more desirable results and fortunes which will make our Vision and School mission statement realistic to everyone in this country and the outside world
